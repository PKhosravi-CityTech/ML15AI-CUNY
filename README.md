## 🛠 Installation & Setup  
### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKhosravi-CityTech/ML15AI-CUNY.git
cd ML15AI-CUNY
```
### Open in Google Colab (Recommended)
To run the notebooks interactively without installation, open them in Google Colab:

🟠 Click the Colab badge inside each week's folder to open the corresponding notebooks.

🟡 Colab allows you to execute code without local setup.

🟢 You can read the theoretical explanations inside the Jupyter Notebooks.

🟣 For better visualization, watch the accompanying videos.
