## Course Overview  

📚 Comprehensive 15-week curriculum designed for aspiring ML practitioners

🛠️ Hands-on coding with Python, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow

💻 Jupyter Notebooks + Google Colab support for seamless experimentation

📊 Real-world datasets (UCI ML, TCIA, Kaggle) to bridge theory and practice

🎥 Curated video resources—handpicked free content to visually explain key concepts (not my own recordings, but complementary to the course)

✨ Engaging explanations & interactive coding—text sections written based on core ML concepts and real student questions to reinforce understanding before coding

🤝 Collaborative discussions & knowledge-sharing

---

## 🛠 Installation & Setup  
### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKhosravi-CityTech/ML15AI-CUNY.git
cd ML15AI-CUNY
```
### Open in Google Colab (Recommended)
To run the notebooks interactively without installation, open them in Google Colab:

🟠 Click the Colab badge inside each week's folder to open the corresponding notebooks.

🟡 Colab allows you to execute code without local setup.

🟢 You can read the theoretical explanations inside the Jupyter Notebooks.

🟣 For better visualization, watch the accompanying videos.
